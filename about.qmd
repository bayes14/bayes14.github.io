I am a mathematician (PhD from [University of Copenhagen](https://www.math.ku.dk/english/)) and data scientist ([Maersk](https://maersk.com)). On this site you can find more information about me and some of my projects.

## Research and Interests
My research interests lie within dynamical systems theory, both deterministic and stochastic, especially within reaction networks.

I also enjoy working on statistical properties of dynamical systems within time-series forecasting, and I'm interested in all aspects of Bayesian data analysis.

* Existence of a unique quasi-stationary distribution in stochastic reaction networks, [Electron. J. Probab. 25: 1-30 (2020)](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/electronic-journal-of-probability/volume-25/issue-none/Existence-of-a-unique-quasi-stationary-distribution-in-stochastic-reaction/10.1214/20-EJP445.full)
